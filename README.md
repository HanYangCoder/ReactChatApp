# My React Chat App

This is a simple chat app built with React, NodeJS, Socket.io, and Express

To run the chat app clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/HanYangCoder/ReactChatApp.git`

Install dependencies for client and server:
`cd server`
`npm install`
`cd client`
`npm install`

Start the server:
`cd server`
`npm start`

Start the client:
`cd client`
`npm run dev`

Open two browser windows and navigate to the client server on localhost and use these credentials to login on the two accounts

- Username: john, Password: password1
- Username: jane, Password: password2


Once logged in, enter the same chat room numbers.


That's it folks! Thank you for checking out my app! I hope you enjoyed my weekend's worth of learning!
